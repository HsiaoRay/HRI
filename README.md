# HRI
Human Robot Interaction
----

Repository for HRI course project. It involves a NAO robot cooking assistant, which guides the user through a recipe and is capable of understanding and answering questions in natural language. Also, the robot directs her gaze at the user during conversation.

Natural language processing is done through the [wit.ai](http://wit.ai) API.
